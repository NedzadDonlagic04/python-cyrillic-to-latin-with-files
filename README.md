# python-cyrillic-to-latin-with-files

The goal of this python project is to make a
python script that normally asks for text
in Serbian cyrillic and converts it to latin.
If the user opts to use the -f or --filename
flag and gives a valid .txt file the script 
will convert it to latin and output it.
